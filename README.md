### Use case
The client @TheBridge_Tech  wants to develop a social media monitoring to measure the impact of the brand and develop commercial actions.

g. Public metrics of the tweet (retweet, reply, like, quote)

2. To store them in an SQL database in 2 normalized tables (tweets, user)

3. To perform a business analysis 
<!-- a. What is the tweet with the greatest social impact?
b. Which user mentions the school the most?
c. In which month is the greatest number of tweets concentrated?
d. Which words are more frequent?
e. What kind of mathematical correlation do you find between public metrics?
f. Have you drawn any extra conclusions in your analysis? -->

4. To use a pre-trained model to determine the sentiment of tweets.
Question:
<!-- a. What are the predictions? Interpret the results.
b. Which variables are the most important in the model?
c. How could you improve the model?
d. What other opportunities can you think of where other
ML models? -->

5. To deploy the model with an endpoint where to be able to send you a body text and return the feeling prediction.
