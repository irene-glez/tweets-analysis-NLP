### Use case
The client @TheBridge_Tech wants to develop a social media monitoring to measure the impact of the brand during the lapse of a bootcamp, in order to design commercial actions.


### I've perform the following tasks:
1. Collection of the tweets where the @TheBridge_Tech account is mentioned from the first day of the bootcamp (13 June) until the last day of class (5 October).

2. Storage in an SQL database in 2 normalized tables (tweets, users).

3. Business analysis.

4. To determine the sentiment of the tweets, and find with NLP hte most relevant hashtags, n-grams...

5. Deloyment of a Flask API with a pretrained model to consult the predictions for new tweets.
