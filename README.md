# tweets-analysis-NLP and APi deployment
Use case of a client (@TheBridge_Tech) who wants to develop a social media monitoring to measure the impact of the brand and develop commercial actions.
(API, NLP, MLOps)

### Welcome!
 
Thank you for taking an interest in my proyect 🙂
 
Here I've worked with:

Python 🐍 · Sqlite3 🔍 · Pandas 🐼 · SciKitLearn 🥼 · NLTK 📖 · Regex 💬 · WordCloud 🌥 · TextBlob 🆎 · Flask 🦏 · Postman 🐱‍🏍 ·  Pythonanywhere

### Use case
The client @TheBridge_Tech wants to develop a social media monitoring to measure the impact of the brand during the lapse of a Bootcamp, in order to design commercial actions.


### I've perform the following tasks:

0. Training a classification model with a Corpus of Tweets in Spanish.

1. Collection of the tweets where the @TheBridge_Tech account is mentioned from the first day of the bootcamp (13 June) until the last day of class (5 October).

2. Storage in an SQL database in 2 normalized tables (tweets, users).

3. Business analysis.

4. To determine the sentiment of the tweets, NER, and find with NLP the most relevant hashtags, n-grams...

5. Deloyment of a Flask API with the model and the database to easily access the predictions for new tweets.
